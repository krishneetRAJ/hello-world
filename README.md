# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow(CodeDay Onboarding Assignment for MicroInternship 2024 through CTI)

My name is Krishneet Raj. I'm a second year computer science major attending both California State University, Monterey Bay and Hartnell Community College. I have experience working on Python and C++, as well as frameworks like Tensorflow and Matplotlib. I am doing this to complete an onboarding assignment for a microinternship that I do(this is a required step).
